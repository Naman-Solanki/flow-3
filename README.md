# Flow 3

The CryptoPoops smart contract introduces a basic implementation of a non-fungible token (NFT) collection using the Cadence programming language on the Flow blockchain. This contract offers features such as NFT minting, collection management, deposit, and withdrawal functionality, along with a public interface for interacting with the NFTs.

## Components

### NFT Resource

The NFT resource defines unique non-fungible tokens with distinct properties such as name, favorite food, and lucky number.

### Collection Resource

The Collection resource serves as a manager for handling NFT ownership within a collection. It facilitates functions for depositing, withdrawing, and retrieving NFTs.

### MintingFacility Resource

The MintingFacility resource provides functionalities for generating new NFTs and managing minting operations.

## Usage

1. **Minting NFTs**: Use the MintingFacility resource to create new NFTs with specified properties.

2. **Creating Collections**: Establish an empty NFT collection using the `createEmptyNFTCollection` function.

3. **Depositing and Withdrawing**: Engage with the NFT collection by depositing and withdrawing NFTs using appropriate functions.

4. **Public Interface**: Access the public interface to interact with functions for NFT deposit, retrieval, and borrowing.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed for Cadence development.

2. **Deploy Contract**: Deploy the smart contract to the Flow blockchain to start utilizing its functionalities.

3. **Interact with Contract**: Utilize the provided functions to interact with the smart contract, including minting NFTs, managing collections, and depositing/withdrawing NFTs.

## Notes

- The CryptoPoops smart contract provides a foundation for building more sophisticated NFT collections and related applications on the Flow blockchain.
- Developers can extend and customize the contract according to their specific requirements, adding additional features and functionalities as necessary.
